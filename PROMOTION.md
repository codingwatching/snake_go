**Title**: I built a modular Snake game with Go, WebSockets, and a pathfinding AI.

**Body**:
Hey everyone! I’ve been working on a modern iteration of Snake that combines a Go logic engine with a high-performance Canvas frontend. 

**Key Technical Features:**
- **Modular Frontend**: Decoupled rendering and audio engines using ES Modules.
- **WebSocket Sync**: Real-time state synchronization between the Go server and the browser.
- **Combat Mechanics**: Added fireballs and AI stunning for a more aggressive gameplay loop.
- **Rich Feedback**: Floating score bubbles, haptics, and multi-stage physics-based particles.
